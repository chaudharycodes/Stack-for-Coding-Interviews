# [Stack-for-Coding-Interviews](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNgAQPlMqdg) ðŸ“š
A curated set of 15 popular stack interview problems, progressing from easy to hard. ðŸ“ˆ

Starting from the easiest problems on LeetCode and InterviewBit. âœ…

Then, slowly build up the intuitions, so that even the hard problems feel easy. ðŸ§ 

*All the questions are popular interview questions from Google, Meta, Microsoft and more!*


## Course Contents ðŸ“–
***The problems are picked so that ALL the stack related concepts are covered, with the least amount of time required.***

We start from some easy handy tricks --> All the way to multi-level hacks

### [SECTION 0: Introduction](https://github.com/chaudharycodes/Stack-for-Interviews/tree/main/0.%20Introduction)
*Get started with these questions to get a feel of what the stack data structure can be used for.*

- Introduction to the course on the Stack data structure (video only)
- Stack implementation intuitions + Code in Python3 and C++ (video only)
- Simplify Path | InterviewBit | LeetCode
- Min Stack | InterviewBit | LeetCode

### [SECTION 1: Parentheses](https://github.com/chaudharycodes/Stack-for-Interviews/tree/main/1.%20Parentheses)
*Questions about parentheses are asked quite often in coding interview rounds.*

- Introduction to Parentheses questions (video only)
- Valid Parentheses | InterviewBit | LeetCode
- Redundant Braces | InterviewBit
- Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses | LeetCode
- Longest Valid Parentheses | LeetCode

### [SECTION 2: Calculator](https://github.com/chaudharycodes/Stack-for-Interviews/tree/main/2.%20Calculator)
*This is one of those "irritating" type of questions - it is a pain to solve; regardless you should know how to do it.*

- Introduction to Calculator questions (video only)
- Convert Infix to Postfix
- Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation| InterviewBit | LeetCode

### [SECTION 3: Monotonic Stack](https://github.com/chaudharycodes/Stack-for-Interviews/tree/main/3.%20Monotonic%20Stack)
*This is perhaps the most tricky part of the stack data structure. This is also asked a lot in coding rounds, and "Tier-1" companies love to ask this.*
